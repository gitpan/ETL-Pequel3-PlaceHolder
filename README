ETL-Pequel3-PlaceHolder version 0.01
====================================

INTRODUCTION
------------

pequel -- Generate Perl programs for data transformation processes.

Pequel is a comprehensive data processing and transformation system. It features a simple, 
user-friendly event driven interface that transparently generates, builds and executes 
highly efficient data-processing programs. The Pequel interface is based on a 'Declarative 
Programming' paradigm. By using Pequel the user can create and maintain complex ETL data 
transformation and distributed data processes quickly, easily, and accurately. 

Pequel transformation definitions can be prepared using one of these methods: 
  - a perl program calling the ETL::Pequel3::User module interface; 
  - an XML script based on the provided 'pequel.xsd' XML-Schema; 
  - a hash or hash-dump describing the Pequel Object Model (POM). 

Pequel is hosted on sourceforge:

Test
----

The tests provided in the Pequel module package are memory and CPU intensive and it is highly 
recommended that a minimum system configuration af B<512MB> memory is available. In fact, anything 
less could cause some tests to fail (wait timeouts, etc). On a Pentium 4 2.4GHz system with 512MB 
on Cygwin, the tests take about 1.5 hours to run. Please note that this does not reflect the 
efficiency (or lack of) by a stand-alone generated pequel program -- the slowness is caused by 
the I<evals> going on in the test scripts.
